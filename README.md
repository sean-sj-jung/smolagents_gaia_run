### AI Agent Built with SmolAgents

This project demonstrates an AI agent framework built using SmolAgents, featuring a suite of custom tools for multimodal input processing:
- Visual Agent: Answers questions about images using visual question answering (VQA) models
- Audio Agent: Transcribes audio input into text
- Code Reader: Reads and interprets code files (without executing them)
- Wikipedia Search Tool: Retrieves information using the wikipedia-api
- Video Processor: Downloads short YouTube videos and processes them using a vision-language model

The agent is evaluated using sample queries from the GAIA dataset.
